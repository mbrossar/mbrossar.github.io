<span class="fas fa-briefcase" aria-hidden="true"></span> I am a French PhD student who lives in Paris and works in  probabilistic robotics at the [MINES ParisTech](http://www.mines-paristech.fr/) Centre of Robotics. I am generously assisted by thesis director and advisor Silvère Bonnabel and Axel Barrau. 

<span class="fas fa-briefcase" aria-hidden="true"></span>  My work focus on autonomous navigation and essentially addresses the following question: How can a mobile robot or an autonomous vehicle localize itself and builds a map of its environment with sensors like GPS, inertial measurement units, or camera ? I have a keen interest in combining deep/machine learning frameworks with traditional filtering methods of state estimation. My PhD research, furthermore, has enabled me to extensively develop my skill programming skills in Python and C++.

<i class="fas fa-graduation-cap"></i> I obtained my MS in automatic control and signal processing from the University Paris-Saclay, France, and graduated from the École Normale Supérieure (ENS) in Cachan, France.

<i class="fas fa-heart"></i> I am an avid runner, enjoy meeting new people traveling <i class="fas fa-globe-europe"></i> and  participating in philosophical debates.
