<span class="fas fa-briefcase" aria-hidden="true"></span> I live and work in Paris, France, where I’m a french Ph. D. student in probabilistic robotics at Centre of Robotics, [MINES ParisTech](http://www.mines-paristech.fr/). My thesis director and advisor are Silvère Bonnabel and Axel Barrau. I am gratuful to them !

<span class="fas fa-briefcase" aria-hidden="true"></span>  My work is focused on  _autonomous navigation_. Concretely, I must answer the question: _``How a mobile robot or an autonomous vehicle can localize itself and builds a map of its environment (with sensors like GPS, inertial measurement units, or camera)?_". I appreciate switching between theory and practise, and combining  deep/machine learning frameworks with traditional methods of state estimation.
 
<i class="fas fa-code"></i> My Ph. D. brings me to highly develop my skill programming. In the past several years I broadly used Matlab  and now I'm becoming fine with both Python <i class="fab fa-python"></i> and C++.

<i class="fas fa-graduation-cap"></i> I obtained my MSc in automatic control and signal processing from the University Paris-Saclay, France. I am also diplomated from the École Normale Supérieure (ENS) Cachan, France.

<i class="fas fa-heart"></i> I'm addicted to running, like sports and particularly soccer, meeting new people, and I have given periods for travelling <i class="fas fa-globe-europe"></i> and getting into philosophical debates.

<somebbob@example.com>) a message! I will do my best to answer quickly.
